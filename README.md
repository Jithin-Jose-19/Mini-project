# Mini-project
Image classifier using logistic regression

This is a simple Image Classifier of CAR vs MOTORCYCLE which is created using one of the classification algorithms named "Logistic Regression".

The popular libraries used are numpy , pandas and scikit learn.

This project invloves the following steps

1.Gathering data
2.Preprocessing of data
3.Applying the Logistic regresssion  algorithm 
4.Evaluating the model using confusion matrix and classification reports
5.Predict for any new image
